paper trading, which can easily be configured for realtime trading.  <br>
Just add your api key and secret and the bot is ready to play with the big boys,  <br>
once i'm done it will give the other bots a serious run for their money also.

the internals section is where the bot is supposed to explain to me how it makes his decisions,  <br>
